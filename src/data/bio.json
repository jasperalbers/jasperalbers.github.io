  "bio": "I am a PhD student with Prof. Dr. Markus Diesmann and Prof. Dr. Sacha J. van Albada at IAS-6, Research Center Jülich. My goal is to understand how the spatial connectivity structure of visual brain areas lead to efficient computations such as object detection. To this end, I am constructing and simulating large-scale biologically realistic neural networks of early visual areas constrained by anatomical and physiological data. In my free time I like to play disc golf in the woods 🥏🌲, hike across mountains 🏔️, and create graphic design 👨🏼‍🎨."
