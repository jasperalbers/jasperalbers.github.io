  "bio": "I am a Software Consultant at TNG Technology Consulting living in London, UK 🇬🇧. I recently handed in my PhD thesis under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Markus Diesmann and Prof. Dr. Sacha J. van Albada at IAS-6, Research Center Jülich. During my time as a PhD student, I worked to further our understanding of how the spatial connectivity structure of visual brain areas leads to efficient computations such as object detection. To this end, I constructed and simulated large-scale biologically realistic neural networks of early visual areas constrained by anatomical and physiological data. In my free time I like to play disc golf in the woods 🥏🌲, hike across mountains 🏔️, and create graphic design 👨🏼‍🎨."
